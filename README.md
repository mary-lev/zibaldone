Zibaldone "Pensieri" Digital Edition
===============

This project is a 48-hour Digital Edition endeavor focused on reconstructing a [previous edition of Zibaldone's "Pensieri"](https://github.com/Alessia438/Zibaldone_di_pensieri.github.io/) with [EVT framework](http://evt.labcd.unipi.it/). It involved addressing various issues, including ensuring that missing sources and images were properly linked. Additionally, a foundation for an English version of this work was established, including the insertion and markup of pages 9 to 13.

## Usage

- To access the project, download it using the git command `git clone https://github.com/mary-lev/zibaldone.git`
- Run the project as a Live Server directly from Visual Studio Code's command palette.

## Customization

Modify the config/config.json file to switch between the Italian and English versions:

`json
"dataUrl": "data/text/zibaldone_en.xml"
`

Change the above URL to `zibaldone_it.xml` to view the full Italian version.

## Contribution

- Edit the data/text/zibaldone_en.xml file to contribute your English pages to the project.
